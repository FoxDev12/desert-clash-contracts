**Token total supply:** 10 million tokens

When 6,5 million $GOLD is collected, token generation will stop. The remaining 3,5 million tokens will go to the owner&#39;s wallet.

**MINT PRICING:**

Note that the first 500 mints will go towards the dev wallet for things like giveaways

| **GENERATION** | **MINT AMOUNT** | **MINT PRICE** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GEN 0 | 500 - 5000 | 0.03 WETH |
| GEN 1 | 5001-12500 | (SEE DESCRIPTION BELOW THIS TABLE) |

Once GEN1 start (after 5000 NFTs are minted) the mint price won&#39;t be in ETH anymore but in our native token ($GOLD), the mint price will gradually increase every 200 mints that happen, and the mint price will increase 10 $GOLD every time.

## MINT MECHANICS
The limit is 5 mints per transaction, and 35 NFTs per wallet.

When you mint through the website, the mint has a 90% chance to be a camel, a 10% chance to be a bandit (thief) for the first 5000 mints.

 After that, there will be another 5000 mints with the same mechanics - a 90% chance to get a camel, a 10% chance to get a bandit, but it&#39;s a bit different from the first 5000 since the second 5000 mints have a 10% chance of being stolen by a staked bandit. So there is a 10% chance you don&#39;t get your mint at all.

Basically, when a mint gets stolen it gets transferred to the wallet of a random staked bandit.

## GAME MECHANICS

**Camel:** There is a 90% chance you get a camel when you mint, a staked camel will generate 20 $GOLD per day (so 0.83 $GOLD per hour). When you claim your $GOLD by either pressing on the &quot;collect&quot; button, or by pressing on the &quot;collect &amp; unstake&quot; button 15% of the claimed $GOLD gets split between all staked bandits as toll.

**Bandit:** There is a 10% chance that you get a bandit when you mint. Bandits have 2 mechanics, the first one is that they make money by collecting toll from camels (15%), and the second one is only valid after the first 5000 mints have happened (so in GEN1 and onwards), the second one is that when a mint gets stolen (10% chance), it gets airdropped to the wallet of a random, staked bandit.

**YOU CAN ONLY LIST YOUR BANDITS &amp; CAMELS FOR SALE ON OPENSEA WHEN THEY&#39;RE UNSTAKED, WHEN YOU STAKE A BANDIT OR CAMEL THE NFT GETS SEND TO A DIFFERENT WALLET, AND WHEN YOU UNSTAKE IT GETS SEND TO YOUR WALLET AGAIN!**

## Anti-inflationary mechanism

When claiming on day 1 of staking (so within the first 24 hours), your camel has a 50% chance of losing its staked $GOLD

When claiming on day 2 of staking (so between 24 hours and 48 hours), your camel has a 45% chance of losing its staked $GOLD

When claiming on day 3, your camel has a 40% chance of losing its staked $GOLD

When claiming on day 4, your camel has a 35% chance of losing its staked $GOLD

When claiming on day 5, your camel has a 30% chance of losing its staked $GOLD

When claiming on day 6, your camel has a 25% chance of losing its staked $GOLD

When claiming on day 7, your camel has a 20% chance of losing its staked $GOLD

When claiming on day 8, your camel has a 15% chance of losing its staked $GOLD

When claiming after day 9, your camel has a 10% chance of losing its staked $GOLD

Half of the stolen $GOLD is burned, and the other half is sent to the Bandits

## Art

For the 1250 bandits, we have 6 trait categories (including the basemodel). I&#39;m going to list them from the layer most in the background to the layer most upfront:
    
- Background -- all with equal rarity
- Bandit -- this is the basemodel
- Eyes -- all with equal rarity
- Face Accessories -- 1/10 bandits should have random eyewear, which all have equal rarities
- Weapons -- 1/2 bandits should have a random weapon, which all have equal rarities
- Companions -- 1/5 bandits should have a random companion, which all have equal rarities

For the 11250 camels, we have 7 trait categories (including the basemodel). I&#39;m going to list them from the layer most in the background to the layer most upfront:

- Background -- all with equal rarity
- Tree -- all with equal rarity
- Camel -- this is the basemodel
- Necklace -- 1/8 camels should have a random necklace, both with equal rarities
- Headwear -- 1/4 camels should have random headwear, which all have equal rarities
- Back Accessories -- 1/2 camels should have random backwear, which all have equal rarities
- Smoking -- 1/4 camels should have random backwear, which all have equal rarities

Also note this:

- Every NFT has to be named accordingly to their type, so \&lt;type\&gt; #\&lt;number\&gt;. For example: the fifth bandit would be names &#39;Bandit #5&#39;, while the 103rd camel would be named &#39;Camel #103&#39; - We need the website to be linked under every NFT, please link this:[https://desertclash.com/](https://desertclash.com/)

- We need the Twitter to be linked under every NFT, please link this:[https://twitter.com/desertclash](https://twitter.com/desertclash)
- For the Description on Opensea, we would like to have the following: &#39;Desert Clash is an NFT stake to earn game running on Polygon, in which bandits are demanding $GOLD from the vulnerable camels traveling through the desert. All the metadata and images are generated and stored 100% on-chain.&#39; So that would be here:

- For the &#39;About Desert Clash&#39; section, we&#39;d like the following description: &#39;In a seemingly peaceful civilization that lives in the desert, in which each village has its own agriculture, and produces its own goods, good transport between villages is crucial to make sure that other villages get the right goods. Camels do just that, it&#39;s their job to transfer goods between villages, and make sure every village gets the - often essential - goods on time, and in return camels get a transportation commission paid out in their native currency, $GOLD.

This worked for years, but unfortunately, the job of camels isn&#39;t as easy as it may seem anymore. One day, camels started to get besieged by bandits who wanted the goods that the camels were carrying. This caused the camels to be in a dilemma: how were they going to earn their share of commission when all the goods they were supposed to deliver, were stolen by these bandits?

After years, the camels finally came up with a treaty - toll: in exchange for the camels giving a part of their commission $GOLD to the bandits, they&#39;d finally be allowed to safely traverse the road again. No one knows how long this treaty will last, and if every bandit will respect it, but it works, for now...
